# MillionaireMart

Deployed link (heroku):  https://millionairemart.herokuapp.com/ <br>
Github link: https://github.com/yeddyfit/marketplace-project
<br>

### Purpose
Some people have too much money, and don't know what to spend it on. There are many marketplaces out there on the internet, but not a huge amount that advance blatant anti-frugality. This is a place that brings together those with too much money, with those who want to make money. Think of it like a bank, except something turns up at your door that next week. <br>
Like 7/11 but for millionaires. NOTE: MillionaireMART is different to billionaireMART. 

<br>
There currently is no marketplace to buy/sell custom embroidery designs/services. This app aims to provide a place where artists can sell their embroidery designs, and customers can buy these designs to be printed onto fabric with an embroidery machine.
<br>
NOTE: need to identify WHY it is a problem that needs solving.
